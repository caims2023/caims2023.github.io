Dr. Adam Stinchcombe is an applied mathematician. His research interests
include scientific computing and mathematical biology, especially
pertaining to circadian biology, retinal physiology, biological fluid
flows, and inverse problems. He develops mathematical models in close
collaboration with experimentists and invents analytical tools and
numerical methods to analyze these models. Adam earned a PhD in
mathematics at New York University in 2013 under the supervision of Dan
Tranchina and Charlie Peskin for his modelling of stochastic gene
expression. While a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor at the University
of Michigan under the supervision of Danny Forger, he developed
mathematical models of the mammalian molecular circadian clock and the
electrophysiology of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
cells. He is presently an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the
University of Toronto.

Saifuddin Syed is a Florence Nightengale Bicentennial Fellow and Tutor in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Oxford's Department of Statistics. Before this, Saif completed a postdoc at Oxford with Arnaud Doucet and a PhD at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of Alexandre Bouchard-Côté. His research involves exploiting the tools from probability theory, statistical physics and differential geometry to design scalable algorithms and robust for Bayesian inference. Saif's thesis titled "Non-reversible parallel tempering on optimized paths" received this year's Pierre Robillard Award from the Statistical Society of Canada and the Cecil Graham Doctoral Dissertation Award from the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society.

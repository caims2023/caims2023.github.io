<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Description</h3>

The scope of our proposed minisymposium is to highlight recent and novel within-host mathematical modelling works. These include viral infection dynamics and the resulting immune response, bottleneck dynamics, humoral and cellular immune response from vaccines and modelling vaccine effectiveness. Diseases included are Reovirus, Cancer, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. There are various applications of the within-host modelling approach. It is crucial to informing long-term immune dynamics, and thus vaccine efficacy time dependence, as well as informing viral resurgence under various therapeutic regimes.

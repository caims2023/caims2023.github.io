<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Description</h3>

The aim of this minisymposium will be to bring together researchers working across a broad range of application areas with the unifying themes of mathematical modelling, asymptotic methods, and nonlinear dynamics. The speakers will discuss exciting applications in areas such as continuum mechanics, pattern formation, ecology and epidemiology. By leveraging the unifying characteristics and ubiquity of the underlying themes, it is envisioned that this session will serve to reinforce existing and foster new connections and collaborations.

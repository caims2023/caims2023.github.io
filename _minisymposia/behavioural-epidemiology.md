<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Description</h3>

Effective management of epidemics requires not only modeling the disease itself but also human responses to information, policies, and socioeconomic contexts. This calls for a new paradigm in mathematical epidemiology, called Behavioral Epidemiology, which integrates theories of human behavior from sociology and psychology. Disease modeling includes various approaches such as agent-based, deterministic and stochastic differential equations, and game-theoretic models. For this mini-symposium, we will present extensions to these frameworks where disease spread or mitigation is modified by behavioural elements. These models will be invaluable to disease modelers and public health managers moving forward.

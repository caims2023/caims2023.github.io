D.W. Thompson said, “Numerical precision is the very soul of science.” The primary focus of this mini-symposium will be on the latest advancements in the development of precision techniques for algorithms that deliver both speed and accuracy while simultaneously requiring low memory resources. Such algorithms introduce crucial modifications, including encorporating stochastic rounding with reduced precision and leveraging mixed-precision methodologies. Several high-performance computing applications utilize these approaches, such as weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, computational physics, etc. Attendees can expect to explore the strengths and limitations of these techniques, including their efficacy in delivering superior performance, reliability, and efficiency.

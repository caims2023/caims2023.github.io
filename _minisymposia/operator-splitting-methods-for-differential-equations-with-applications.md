Operator splitting is a common strategy for solving differential equations. It is mostly borne of necessity -- divide is necessary for conquer. Real-world problems quickly become intractable due to size or time required to simulate. However, operator splitting can also be as much art as science. This minisymposium brings together speakers who will discuss some of the theoretical underpinnings of operator splitting as well as their implementation and use in practical applications.

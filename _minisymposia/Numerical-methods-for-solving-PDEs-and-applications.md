<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Description</h3>

This mini symposium brings together researchers who work on design and analysis of computational methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We aim to discuss the latest trends in numerical methods for solving PDEs arising from interdisciplinary applications in science and engineering. These include classical methods such as finite differences, finite elements, and spectral methods for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Among the talks include designing software for numerical solution of PDEs, parallel solver for PDEs and fast solvers for nonlinear PDEs. Applications include correction function method to solve electromagnetic problems, finite element for a biological model, spectral methods for Navier-Stokes equations.

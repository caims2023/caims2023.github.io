Spatially patterned structures play an important role in various scientific disciplines such as epidemic studies and criminal behaviours. This session showcases new research on reaction-diffusion systems that exhibit complex spatial-temporal dynamics including oscillations and chaos as well as complex dynamics within epidemiological models.

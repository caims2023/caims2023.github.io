Computational Neuroscience is an interdiscipinary field which employs a broad spectrum of analytical and computational techniques to study and understand the functioning of the brain.  This minisymposium will bring together researchers studying problems ranging the from the generation of oscillations (rhythms) in the electrical activity of the brain to the coding of information in the brain. Analysis techniques used in these problems include network analysis, machine learning, dynamical systems theory and bifurcation analysis, and criticality and branching processes.

# HQP Travel Support for CAIMS 2023

CAIMS is offering travel support for HQP (graduate students and postdoctoral research associates) attending the CAIMS 2023 Annual Meeting in-person, to help defray the costs of attendance at the conference.  These funds have been made available, in part, through the generosity of our past prize winners, Anita T. Layton, Nilima Nigam and Frithjof Lutscher, who requested that their prize money be used to support HQP travel.  We are most grateful to Professors Layton, Nigam, and Lutscher for their generosity!

## Eligibility

Any graduate student or postdoctoral research associate (HQP) who is
attending a Canadian university, and do not qualify for AARMS award (AARMS has a separate travel award - see the conference web page), and
presenting a talk or poster at CAIMS 2023 in person
is eligible to apply.  The application process is first-come, first-served.  Support will be awarded to complete, qualifying applications until the allotted funds are exhausted.  Funds may be used to cover travel, accommodations, and/or registration expenses.  Funds will be disbursed after the conference following submission of receipts.

## Award Amounts
- $500 for HQP travelling from points in Ontario, Quebec or the Atlantic provinces
  (assuming they do not qualify for the [AARMS Junior Researcher Travel Support Program](aarms-travel-support.html) )

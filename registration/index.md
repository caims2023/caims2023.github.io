# How to Register

Please visit the [**Registration Page**](https://site.pheedloop.com/event/caims2023) to register for the meeting.  After registering, 
all meeting participants are invited to complete this [short voluntary survey](https://mun.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eb5t4wUhqMBAqzA).
All responses are valuable, and your response will help CAIMS quantify the participation of underrepresented groups in the annual meeting.

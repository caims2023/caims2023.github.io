title: CAIMS•SCMAI Code of Conduct
---

This code of conduct was discussed with the CAIMS•SCMAI board during 2018/19. All CAIMS•SCMAI members and all participants of CAIMS•SCMAI supported activities are expected to adhere to the following ethical principles.

## Equity and Diversity

1. Event organizers are committed to make CAIMS•SCMAI events productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, or religion.

2. Members and participants must behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, or stalking. It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion, verbally, written, or online.

3. All communication and publications should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

6. Individuals that are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Actions, if needed:
Attendees of an event violating any of the rules 1.-6. may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a refund of any amount.

This page lists participants to the conference, together with information about their "roles": plenary (P), minisymposia (MS) and contributed talks (C) speakers, minisymposium organisers (SO), Scientific (SC) or Local Organising (LO) committees members. 
The list will be expanded as talks are accepted and abstracts processed.

Participants/speakers: if you notice any issue with your information, email the local organisers ([caims.agm@gmail.com](mailto:caims.agm@gmail.com)). Please note that as of 1 May we are putting the program online. If you do not see your name posted yet, please check back in a few days.

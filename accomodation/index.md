# On campus Housing

A block of rooms has been reserved through on-campus housing.  Details and links will be posted as soon as available.
On campus housing is a short walk to the venue and banquet locations.

A 30 minute walk from campus can get you to the historic downtown core or to the north side of the Wolastoq River via a scenic walking bridge.

Management of the COVID-19 pandemic required the deployment of non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [social isolation, physical distancing, mask-wearing, hand-washing], and administration of repeated doses of vaccine as they became available. We are interested in the consequences for the dynamics of  variable adherence to the NPIs, and the motivation generating the lack thereof, so we investigate a model for the change in attitude post-infection.
A basic SEIRS model is expanded by a. introducing a structure in the infectious class, to reflect the variable severity of symptoms and the presence of asymptomatic cases; and b. considering the population divided into two classes according to their degree  of adherence to the NPIs.
Analysis of the ensuing model is guided by epidemiological observations in Québec.

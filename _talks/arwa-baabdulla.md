Reovirus is a nonpathogenic virus that inhabits the enteric tract of mammals. It is a double-stranded RNA virus that showed the ability to naturally infect and lyse tumors under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Unmodified reovirus (T3wt) is currently being evaluated as an anti-cancer therapy in more than 30 clinical trials in different types of cancer such as metastatic breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Dr. Maya Shmulevitz from Li-Ka Shing Institute of Virology, University of Alberta and her PhD student Francisca Cristi focus in their laboratory to improve reovirus as a cancer therapy. In collaboration with them, we are trying to answer the following questions via mathematical modelling: How far does the virus spread depending on the binding rate? How does the viral invasion speed depend on the binding rate? How does reducing the binding rate affect the plaque size?

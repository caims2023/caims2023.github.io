When fluid motion is induced through a porous medium, the distance
travelled depends on the energy exerted and overall resistance to flow.
Ostensibly intuitive, this concept of reach has proven elusive not only in
delineation, but even mathematical definition. In wells surrounded by a
homogeneous medium it is a circle and thus characterised by a single number
referred to as the radius of influence. The simple definition thereof as
the locus of zero radial velocity yields an infinite or severely
overestimated result, and tempts custom modifications to reconcile the
estimates with reality. In environmental applications such as aquifer
sparging wells, hydraulic and petroleum wells, natural gas and landfill gas
wells, the medium is often highly heterogeneous. We show that the zone of 
collection or dispersal changes shape dramatically based on the interrelation 
of resistance to flow posed by subdomains of distinct permeabilities. In 
contrast to the isotropic case, the mere presence of heterogeneity suggests 
a natural and unambiguous definition of this zone of interest as a set of 
separatrices connecting stagnation points in the flow field, and results in 
realistic estimates. The variability of its shape is remarkable and relates to 
the structural diversity of the parameter space underpinning the flow field. 
The findings help explain the longstanding problem of a reliable delimitation 
of these wells' reach in practice.

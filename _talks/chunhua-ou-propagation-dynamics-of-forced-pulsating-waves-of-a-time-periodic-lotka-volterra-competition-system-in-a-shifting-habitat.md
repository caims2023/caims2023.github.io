Existence, uniqueness and stability of forced pulsating waves as well as gap formation of reaction diffusion models  in a shifting habitat are challenging problems in the field of propagation dynamics. In this talk, we design to tackle these problems for a time periodic Lotka-Volterra competition system.  By  using alternatively-coupling  upper-lower solution method,  we  establish the existence of  forced pulsating traveling wave, as long as   the shifting speed  falls in a finite interval where the  end points are obtained from  KPP-Fisher speeds.  The asymptotic behaviors of the forced pulsating traveling wave  are derived and this helps us  show that this wave  is unique. Moreover in the Lyapunov sense, the  stability of the forced pulsating wave is also studied. Finally, when the forced speed is beyond  the finite interval, gap formation is investigated theoretically and illustrated  further by numerical simulations.

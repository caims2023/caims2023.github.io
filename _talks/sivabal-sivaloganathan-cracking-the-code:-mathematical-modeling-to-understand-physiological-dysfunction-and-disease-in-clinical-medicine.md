This talk explores the challenges and successes of applying mathematics to the biomedical sciences. We illustrate this with examples from hydrocephalus, tumorigenesis, and the use of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in cancer treatment. Mathematical models have provided insights into treatment optimization in hydrocephalus, they have helped to slowly unravel some of the complexities of tumor development and treatment response, and have helped guide the evolution and development of non-invasive HIFU as a cancer therapeutic strategy. These examples demonstrate the profound impact that mathematical modeling can have in understanding physiological dysfunctions and developing effective interventions in clinical medicine.

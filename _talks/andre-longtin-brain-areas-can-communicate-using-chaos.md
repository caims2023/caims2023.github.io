There is increasing evidence that many oscillatory rhythms in brain structures are noise-sustained, i.e. they involve the interaction of a deterministic stable focus with a stochastic process. These quasi-cycles exhibit high amplitude epochs known as "bursts". Amplitudes and durations of bursts are random, and can be modelled by stochastic amplitude-phase dynamics, including delays when distant oscillatory regions interact. We show how these dynamics can be extracted from real brain data, lending support to the quasi-cycle hypothesis. We further show how information transfer between brain regions relies on the chaotic behaviour of the associated coupled amplitude-phase.

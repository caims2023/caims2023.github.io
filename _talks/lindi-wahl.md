Recent phylogenetic evidence suggests that historically, bacterial species have gone extinct at high rates.  This poses a puzzle since many of the usual threats to survival -- such as demographic stochasticity, inbreeding or environmental change -- would often be mitigated by the very large population sizes maintained in microbial populations.  Through a bifurcation analysis of an expanded host-parasite model, we demonstrate that bacterial populations may be driven to extinction, deterministically, when a viral predator of a competing bacterial species expands its host range.  This suggests that viral predators of bacteria (bacteriophages), the most abundant organisms on earth, may be important drivers of bacterial extinctions.

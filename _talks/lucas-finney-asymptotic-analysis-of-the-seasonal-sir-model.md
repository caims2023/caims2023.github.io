Numerical solutions to the seasonal SIR model have shown the existence of subharmonic modes that are characterized by a rapid epidemic and a long inter-epidemic period. In this talk, we apply a layer based asymptotic approach to develop a perturbative framework, which allows the construction of a hierarchy of approximate solutions. We show the close agreement between the approximate solutions and numerical results. Using these approximations, we gain insight into the relationship between the model parameters and the resulting solutions. We also explore the conditions that affect the existence of particular periodic solutions

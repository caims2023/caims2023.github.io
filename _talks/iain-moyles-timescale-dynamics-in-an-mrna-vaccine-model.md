We present an in-host mathematical model for vaccine delivery and antibody response from a liquid nanoparticle formulated mRNA vaccine. Through asymptotic model reduction, we show that five distinct timescales emerge representing priming through to antibody decay. We identify these timescales in a variety of datasets from two mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and compare measured antibody response to model prediction showing good agreement. We exploit the different timescales to investigate the optimal time for second dosage.

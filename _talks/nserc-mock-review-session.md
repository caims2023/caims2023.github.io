The process that NSERC uses to evaluate Discovery Grant proposals is arguably still a black box to those who have never served on the committee. As the current Group Chair of EG1058, I would perform a mock review so those who have never seen one can find out a bit more about what goes on behind the scenes with your grant application. With luck, some people may be encouraged to serve on the committee!

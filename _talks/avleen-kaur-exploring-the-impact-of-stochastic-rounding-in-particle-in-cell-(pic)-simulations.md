Particle-in-cell (PIC) stands out as the preferred approach for simulating kinetic phenomena in the field of plasma physics. It has gained widespread popularity due to its effectiveness and efficiency. However, a significant drawback of the PIC method is its susceptibility to the discrete particle noise problem. This issue arises from the inherent nature of treating the continuous phase space as a finite number of discrete particles.

To address this concern, we embark on a study to evaluate the impact of stochastically rounded computations on mitigating the noise problem in PIC simulations. By introducing stochastic rounding techniques into the computational process, we aim to explore whether this approach can alleviate the adverse effects of discrete particle noise.

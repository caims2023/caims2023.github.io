There are many advantages to solving a complex differential equation with operator-splitting methods. It allows us to utilize the characteristics of individual operators by applying suitable numerical methods to each part. In this talk, we will describe the generalized version of operator-splitting methods with Runge--Kutta methods as sub-integrators. We will disucss the representation in Butcher tableau and linear stability results. Moreover, we will discuss some examples and applications of operator-splitting methods where the right-hand-side a differential equation is split into more than two parts.

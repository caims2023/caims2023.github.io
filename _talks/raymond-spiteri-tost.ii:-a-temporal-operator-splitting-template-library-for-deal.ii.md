Temporal operator splitting (OS) is commonly employed as a
divide-and-conquer strategy for solving differential equations,
especially ordinary differential equations derived from the method of
lines applied to partial differential equations. Fractional-step
temporal OS methods of arbitrary order can be implemented by a simple
abstract pattern. This presentation describes a simple view of the
general OS pattern and presents tost.II, its concrete implementation
that is based on data structures in the deal.II finite-element
library. The versatility and ease-of-use of general OS methods is
demonstrated through several multi-physics examples.

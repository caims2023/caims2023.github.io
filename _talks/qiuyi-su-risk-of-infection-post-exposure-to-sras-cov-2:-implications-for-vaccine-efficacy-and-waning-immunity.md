In this study, we apply TEIV and TEIVF Markov Chain in-host models to reproduce outcomes of the clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy. With estimated and assumed parameters, the risks of infection for both unvaccinated and vaccinated people are derived from simulation and theoretical calculation, from which the vaccine efficacy is calculated. Relationships among parameters and risk of infection are investigated. Parameter distributions can be adjusted to match the vaccine efficay from clinical trials.

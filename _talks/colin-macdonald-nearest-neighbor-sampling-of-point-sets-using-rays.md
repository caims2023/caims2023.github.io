We present a framework for the sampling, compression, and analysis of
point clouds.  Our approach involves the construction of a tensor
called the RaySense sketch, which captures nearest neighbors from the
underlying geometry of points along a set of rays.  Various operations
can be performed on the RaySense sketch: we present examples of
line integrals and classification of point clouds.  This is joint work with
Lewis Liu, Louis Ly, and Richard Tsai.

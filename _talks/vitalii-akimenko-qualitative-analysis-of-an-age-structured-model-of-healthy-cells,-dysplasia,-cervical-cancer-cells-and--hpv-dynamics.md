The qualitative analysis of an autonomous epidemic model of age-structured sub-populations of suscepti-ble, infected, precancerous and cancer cells and unstructured sub-population of human papilloma virus (HPV) (SIPCV epidemic model) aims to gain an insight into the features of cervical cancer disease. The model takes into account the immune response of the organism to the virus population and describes the interaction between susceptible cells and HPV using the Lotka-Voltera incidence rate. The model also considers the growth and death rates of infected, precancerous, and cancerous cells. The conditions for the existence of a positive equilibrium of the system were obtained, and it was proved that the positive equilibrium is always locally asymptotically stable whenever it exists. Numerical experiments confirmed the theoretical results and revealed two types of asymptotically stable dynamical regimes of population (localization of cancer tissue) and two unstable regimes when the positive equilibrium does not exist (formation of cancer metastasis).

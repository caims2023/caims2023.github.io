The study of small-scale capillary-driven ripples riding on steep gravity waves presents a particularly challenging setting for water-wave studies. In this talk, I review some of the open questions that emerged from early studies on the topic. I then describe some of the new technology we have developed that allow exponentially-small ripples to be captured using techniques in exponential asymptotics. New results on the low-Bond limit of gravity-capillary surface waves are presented, including recent work on standing waves and water waves with viscosity.

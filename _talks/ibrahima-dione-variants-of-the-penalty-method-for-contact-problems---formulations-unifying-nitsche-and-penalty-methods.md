The penalty method is a simple yet effective computational technique of handling unilateral contact problems. In addition to its inconsistent, this method is often criticized of ill-conditioning when the penalty parameter goes to zero.

We propose here new penalty methods overcoming the conditioning issue. We also established that some of our penalty formulations are equivalent of variants of Nitscheâ€™s method, meaning that the inconsistent of these penalty methods is insignificant.

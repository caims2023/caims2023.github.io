Dating back to Sophus Lie in the late 1800s, operator splitting is one of the oldest tricks in the book when it comes to solving difficult differential equations. Since then, operator splitting has undergone a number of enhancements, including generalization to higher order, an arbitrary number of operators, complex coefficients, and irreversible systems. In this presentation, I will give a short overview of the rich, multi-century history of operator splitting methods, starting from Lie and ending with codes in the exascale computing project.

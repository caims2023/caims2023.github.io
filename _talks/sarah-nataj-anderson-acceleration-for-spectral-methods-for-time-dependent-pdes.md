In this talk, we consider Anderson acceleration for numerical solution of nonlinear time
dependent partial differential equations discretized by space-time spectral methods, where
classical fixed-point methods converge slowly or even diverge. Specifically, we apply Anderson
acceleration with finite window size w to speed up fixed-point methods in solving
nonlinear reaction diffusion, nonlinear Schrodinger and Navier Stokes equations. We focus
on studying the influence of the window size w on the number of iterations to numerical
convergence. Numerical results show the high efficiency of Anderson acceleration to solve
a variety of nonlinear time dependent problems discretized by space-time spectral methods,
and a small value of w is enough to achieve good performance. This is joint work
with Dr. Yunhui He.

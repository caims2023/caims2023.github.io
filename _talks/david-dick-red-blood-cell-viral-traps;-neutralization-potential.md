Red blood cells (RBCs) that lack nuclei and other organelles required for viral replication have been proposed as viral traps for HIV-1 as an alternative treatment for HIV-1.  Current management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection requires strict adherence to a daily drug regimen to prevent viral rebound. RBCs persistence in-host would require less frequent treatment offering a promising long-lasting control for viral rebound without the requirement for continued adherence to the existing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). 

We develop an in-vitro model to assess the neutralization potential of RBCs targeting HIV-1 by expressing CD4, CCR5, or a CD4-glycophorin A (CD4-GpA) fusion protein and seek to elucidate the requirements for successful use of red blood cell viral traps for suppression of HIV-1 viral rebound and use as a prophylaxis against HIV-1.

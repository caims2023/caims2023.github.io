The response of individuals to influenza vaccines is very variable. It is not fully clear why some individuals generate a strong response while others generate a weak response. Age and pre-existing antibody immunity have been shown to be important factors. Prior vaccination, independent of pre-existing antibody immunity, seems to have a separate impact. We present some data and modeling analyses in an attempt to better understand the contributions of different factors to influenza vaccine responses.

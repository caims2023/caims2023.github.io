In this talk we present a mathematical model of COVID-19 which includes non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) as well as vaccination. The decision to follow NPIs is driven by active case numbers while the decision to resist is driven by a compliance cost. Our model includes wanining immunity from disease, vaccination, as well as a behavioural immunity from perceived protection. We present a counter-factual analysis of the model which includes a variable proportion of people being non-compliant with NPIs as well as vaccination and assess the overall impact on cases and hospitalization.

In this talk I will first review the formulation of PDE based mesh generators. The solution of these PDE based mesh generators by parallel domain decomposition method will be proposed and analyzed. Convergence results for both continuous and discrete formulations of the mesh PDEs will provided. Recent work on surface mesh generation using domain decomposition and the closest point method will be introduced.

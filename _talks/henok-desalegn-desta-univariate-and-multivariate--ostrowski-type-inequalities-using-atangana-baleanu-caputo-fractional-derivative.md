In this talk, we will describe some Univarite and Multivariate Ostrowski type inequalities using Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative in the sense of Lioville-Caputo(ABC). The results  obtained for both left-sided and right-sided ABC fractional derivatives can be applied to study further fractional inequalities and estimate various nonlocal function problems since the operator consists of non-singular kernel. The obtained results are more generalized in nature.

Epidemic models offer valuable insights into responding to an outbreak. In this talk, we examine various aspects of stochastic dynamical systems under different incidence rates and perturbations. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates the existence of global and positive solutions. We investigate the extinction and persistence of the disease. Additionally, we employ appropriate control measures to manage the spreading of an infectious disease using stochastic near-optimal control approach. Finally, we provide numerical illustrations that reinforce our analytical findings.
